Longitudinal phase space reconstruction from TDS measurements and using both zero crossings and miscellaneous analysis in Python.

This is a small Python package for implementing the bunch profile reconstruction algorithm outlined in the appendix of the paper  [_Benchmarking coherent radiation spectroscopy as a tool for high-resolution bunch shape reconstruction at free-electron lasers_](http://www.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.23.062801) by B. Schmidt et. al (2020).
